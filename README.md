## Frequently asked questions
- **[What is Storyblok?](https://www.storyblok.com/)**        
Storyblok is a headless cms - we removed the front-end component (the head) and, what remains is our [content delivery RESTful API](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/Delivery-Api/introduction). - Most of the Content Management Systems force you into a specific way on how to develop a website. With Storyblok you can just plug in the service to your template. There is no need to take care of CMS installation or database setup.<br><br>
- **[How can I access the Storyblok Content Delivery API?](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/Delivery-Api/introduction)**    Â   
You can directly access the API using simple HTTP GET Requests. We've done some examples for you already in our [Delivery APi Introduction](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/Delivery-Api/introduction). <br>You can of course use one of the SDK's available for storyblok:
   - PHP SDK: https://github.com/storyblok/php-client
   - Ruby SDK: https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok-ruby
   - Android SDK: https://github.com/mikepenz/Storyblok-Android-SDK (Great work done by: [@mikepenz](https://github.com/mikepenz))
