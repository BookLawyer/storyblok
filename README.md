## Installation

Make sure you've node `>= 5.11.0` installed.

```
$ npm i storyblok -g
```

## Usage for the quickstart
```
$ storyblok quickstart
```

## Usage for fieldtypes and other boilerplates
```
$ storyblok select
```

## Download your space's components schema as json
```
$ storyblok pull-components --space={{your_space_id}}
```

## Push your components file to your/another space
```
$ storyblok push-components --space={{your_dest_space_id}} {{path/url}}
```

## What it does
We recommend to execute the quickstart command first to learn how easy it is to use Storyblok.

The CLI allows developers to get started with a new Storyblok project by answering 3 questions:
1. How should your Project be named?
2. Select the type of your project (Theme/Boilerplate/Fieldtype)
3. Select your Theme/Boilerplate (skipped for Fieldtypes)

## How will it look like
